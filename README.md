## Description
I wanted to learn how to properly test js files. I built the project so I could learn about js testing while also creating a useful file that allows users to create teams within their work environment. This program is a simple way for a company to display team profiles. I learned how to properly test js files, how to make sure they append properly, how to append an html with styling properly, and how to google lots of stuff.
## Installation
In order to install this project, a user simply needs to pull the data from the repository. They need to make sure that they delete the index.html that is sitting in the output folder since it will not apply to them.
## Usage
In order to use the project, you will need to have node downloaded on your device. You will also need to run it in the console, where you can add all of the information necessary for your teams.
